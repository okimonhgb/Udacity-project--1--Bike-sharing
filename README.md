Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project : Predicting Bike-Sharing using Neural Network

In this project, I build my first neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! 

By building a neural network from the ground up, 
we aim to have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts 
that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. 

In this project, we build our first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

By completing and configuring the base code given by Udacity, I completed to-do parts, tuned hyper-parameters to get 
satisfactory predictions.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
